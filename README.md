#Airbnb clone Project
I'm using this project to learn about modern software development practices, which include Backend design architecture and Database principles among other technologies.
#Team Roles
Software is developed by a team, with each member playing their dedicated role in the development process. Some of the roles include: 
-Business Analyst: They translate an abstract product idea into a set of tangible requirements
-Product owner: Holds the responsibility of making sure the final product meets customer requirements
-Product Manager: Makes sure a product or its part is delivered on time and within budget
-UX/UI designers: Create user journeys for the best user experience and highest conversion rates.
-Software developers: Solves any technical problems emerging during the development lifecycle
-Quality assurance Engineers: Make sure an application performs according to requirements
-Test automation Engineers: Write and maintain test scripts for automated testing
-DevOps engineers: Build continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines for faster delivery
#Tenology Stack
-Django: Back-end server-side web framework. 
-MySQL: Creates a relationship between entities and implements the functionalities for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data through SQL queries or an API
-GraphQL: Improve data fetching and performance, particularly in its mobile and web applications. GraphQL addresses challenges such as service-oriented architecture and data duplication, leading to faster page load times and more efficient data handling. 
#Key Entities
-Users: Stores information about both renters and hosts
-bookings: Tracking reservation details.(e.g., dates, guests, total price)
-Amenities: Listing available amenities
-properties: Details about rental Listings(e.g., location,descriptionn, price.)
-Reviews: Storing feedback and ratings from guests.
#Feature Breakdown
-Channel management: Allows hosts to list properties on multiple platforms (Airbnb, Booking.com, etc.) from a single platform, ensuring consistent pricing and availability
-Financial reporting: Tracks income, expenses, and occupancy rates.
-Calendar Synchronization: Keeps calendars across different platforms synchronized to prevent double bookings and ensure accurate availability.
-Automated Guest Communication: Sends automated messages for check-in/check-out details, payment reminders, and house rules
-Unified Inbox: Consolidates all guest communications from various platforms into one central location
-Guest Screening: Includes features for verifying guest identities and background checks.
#Database Design: 
- These include tables for users, properties, hosts, bookings, reviews, and potentially transactions and amenities. The relationships between these tables would be crucial for managing the platform effectively. 
#API Security
-Security measures to be employed to ensure user data protection and platform integrity include strong encryption, access control, and authentication.
#CI/CD Pipelines
-Airbnb utilizes CI/CD pipelines to automate the building, testing, and deployment of code changes, ensuring faster and more reliable releases. These pipelines incorporate various stages, including continuous integration (CI) for automated code integration and testing, continuous delivery (CD) for making code shippable, and deployment to different environments.
